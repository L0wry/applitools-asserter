# Applitools Asserter

## Concept

Applitools is a great tool but is hard to run in CI due to it's limited integrations.

This tools aims to make integration with Applitools easier by returning information on a batch ID.
For example it could be used as a branch policy on azure dev ops ðŸ¤® (If only I could use Github).

This tool has been built to run on an Azure functions.

All you need to do is do a get request to the deployed function with the following.

`?batchKey=applitoolsBatchID`

`?ApiKey=applitoolsApiKey`

## Example
`axios.get(`${BASE_URL}?apiKey=${apiKey}&batchId=${batchId}`)`

## Installing dependancies
`yarn`

## Running Tests
`yarn test`
